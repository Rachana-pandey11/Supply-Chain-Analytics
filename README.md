# Supply Chain Analytics: A Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning, Statistical, and Time-Series Models  

This research work evaluates the performance of machine learning, statistical, and time-series models for various use cases of supply chain analytics.

# Dataset Description:

We used the "DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS" dataset in this study, which covers data on several supply chain components such as sales, transportation, and stocks.
